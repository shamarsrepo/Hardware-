# Hardware -

It's been a while, but I've still been working towards my goals daily. This week following a power outage my father's PC wouldn't turn on, after hours of troubleshooting I came to the conclusion that it is the result of a failing PSU. 

I installed the new power supply, and it was a great feeling to see those fans start spinning again! A note to myself for doing any PC work next time around would be two things, cable management & compressed air.
